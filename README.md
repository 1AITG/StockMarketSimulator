# StockMarketSimulator

### Description

The app uses simple buttons and clear feedback to make the experience
easy for children. It teaches financial literacy concepts like investment
timing, market volatility, and decision-making under pressure in a playful
environment. Because it’s built in Scratch, it’s easy to understand how the
logic works behind the scenes, inspiring kids not only to learn about stocks
but also to explore basic coding and game design. This stock market simulator is both an educational tool and a fun challenge,
combining math, logic, and financial literacy. It’s a great way for kids to
gain a real understanding of investing in stock markets while enjoying a
simple game experience that encourages curiosity and learning.

### Tutorial

 In our game, your objective is to make as much
money as you can in 10 minutes. You start with
1000$ and you have 2 companies to invest in. Click the
buy and sell buttons to buy shares of each
company. Use the displayed stats to check how much
time, money, and shares you have in each company. Your timer will reset when you click Start Game.
Stock prices will be updated every 3 seconds. If you 
make a profit after 10 minutes, then you win. If you have 
lost money after 10 minutes, then you lose. Your money
in stocks will be counted in your final money. Good luck, 
and have fun!
